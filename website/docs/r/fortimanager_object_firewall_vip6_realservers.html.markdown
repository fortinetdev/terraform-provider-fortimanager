## Argument Reference


The following arguments are supported:

* `scopetype` - The scope of application of the resource. Valid values: `inherit`, `adom`, `global`. The `inherit` means that the scopetype of the provider will be inherited, and adom will also be inherited. The default value is `inherit`.
* `adom` - Adom. This value is valid only when the `scopetype` is `adom`, otherwise the value of adom in the provider will be inherited.
* `vip6` - Vip6.

* `client_ip` - Only clients in this IP range can connect to this real server.
* `healthcheck` - Enable to check the responsiveness of the real server before forwarding traffic. Valid values: `disable`, `enable`, `vip`.

* `holddown_interval` - Time in seconds that the health check monitor continues to monitor an unresponsive server that should be active.
* `http_host` - HTTP server domain name in HTTP header.
* `fosid` - Real server ID.
* `ip` - IPv6 address of the real server.
* `max_connections` - Max number of active connections that can directed to the real server. When reached, sessions are sent to other real servers.
* `monitor` - Name of the health check monitor to use when polling to determine a virtual server's connectivity status.
* `port` - Port for communicating with the real server. Required if port forwarding is enabled.
* `status` - Set the status of the real server to active so that it can accept traffic, or on standby or disabled so no traffic is sent. Valid values: `active`, `standby`, `disable`.

* `translate_host` - Enable/disable translation of hostname/IP from virtual server to real server. Valid values: `disable`, `enable`.

* `weight` - Weight of the real server. If weighted load balancing is enabled, the server with the highest weight gets more connections.


## Attribute Reference

In addition to all the above arguments, the following attributes are exported:
* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format {{fosid}}.

## Import

$ export "FORTIMANAGER_IMPORT_TABLE"="true"
$ terraform import fortimanager_object_firewall_vip6_realservers.labelname {{fosid}}
$ unset "FORTIMANAGER_IMPORT_TABLE"
```
