# fortimanager_object_dlp_sensor_entries
DLP sensor entries.

~> This resource is a sub resource for variable `entries` of resource `fortimanager_object_dlp_sensor`. Conflict and overwrite may occur if use both of them.



## Argument Reference


The following arguments are supported:

* `scopetype` - The scope of application of the resource. Valid values: `inherit`, `adom`, `global`. The `inherit` means that the scopetype of the provider will be inherited, and adom will also be inherited. The default value is `inherit`.
* `adom` - Adom. This value is valid only when the `scopetype` is `adom`, otherwise the value of adom in the provider will be inherited.
* `sensor` - Sensor.

* `fmgcount` - Count of dictionary matches to trigger sensor entry match (Dictionary might not be able to trigger more than once based on its 'repeat' option, 1 - 255, default = 1).
* `dictionary` - Select a DLP dictionary.
* `fosid` - ID.
* `status` - Enable/disable this entry. Valid values: `disable`, `enable`.



## Attribute Reference

In addition to all the above arguments, the following attributes are exported:
* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format {{fosid}}.

## Import

ObjectDlp SensorEntries can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
```
Set import_options = ["sensor=YOUR_VALUE"] in the provider section.

$ export "FORTIMANAGER_IMPORT_TABLE"="true"
$ terraform import fortimanager_object_dlp_sensor_entries.labelname {{fosid}}
$ unset "FORTIMANAGER_IMPORT_TABLE"
```
-> **Hint:** The scopetype and adom for import will directly inherit the scopetype and adom configuration of the provider.
