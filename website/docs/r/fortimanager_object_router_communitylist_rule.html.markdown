## Argument Reference


The following arguments are supported:

* `scopetype` - The scope of application of the resource. Valid values: `inherit`, `adom`, `global`. The `inherit` means that the scopetype of the provider will be inherited, and adom will also be inherited. The default value is `inherit`.
* `adom` - Adom. This value is valid only when the `scopetype` is `adom`, otherwise the value of adom in the provider will be inherited.
* `community_list` - Community List.

* `action` - Permit or deny route-based operations, based on the route's COMMUNITY attribute. Valid values: `deny`, `permit`.

* `fosid` - ID.
* `match` - Community specifications for matching a reserved community.
* `regexp` - Ordered list of COMMUNITY attributes as a regular expression.


## Attribute Reference

In addition to all the above arguments, the following attributes are exported:
* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format {{fosid}}.

## Import

ObjectRouter CommunityListRule can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
```
Set import_options = ["community_list=YOUR_VALUE"] in the provider section.

$ export "FORTIMANAGER_IMPORT_TABLE"="true"
$ terraform import fortimanager_object_router_communitylist_rule.labelname {{fosid}}
