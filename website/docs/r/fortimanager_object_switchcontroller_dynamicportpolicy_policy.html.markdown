  mac                 = "02:42:ac:11:00:02"
  name                = "terr-policy"

## Argument Reference


The following arguments are supported:

* `scopetype` - The scope of application of the resource. Valid values: `inherit`, `adom`, `global`. The `inherit` means that the scopetype of the provider will be inherited, and adom will also be inherited. The default value is `inherit`.
* `adom` - Adom. This value is valid only when the `scopetype` is `adom`, otherwise the value of adom in the provider will be inherited.
* `dynamic_port_policy` - Dynamic Port Policy.

* `n802_1x` - 802.1x security policy to be applied when using this policy.
* `bounce_port_link` - Enable/disable bouncing (administratively bring the link down, up) of a switch port where this policy is applied. Helps to clear and reassign VLAN from lldp-profile. Valid values: `disable`, `enable`.

* `category` - Category of Dynamic port policy. Valid values: `device`, `interface-tag`.

* `description` - Description for the policy.
* `family` - Match policy based on family.
* `host` - Match policy based on host.
* `hw_vendor` - Match policy based on hardware vendor.
* `interface_tags` - Match policy based on the FortiSwitch interface object tags.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all the above arguments, the following attributes are exported:
* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format {{name}}.

## Import

ObjectSwitchController DynamicPortPolicyPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
```
Set import_options = ["dynamic_port_policy=YOUR_VALUE"] in the provider section.

$ export "FORTIMANAGER_IMPORT_TABLE"="true"
$ terraform import fortimanager_object_switchcontroller_dynamicportpolicy_policy.labelname {{name}}
$ unset "FORTIMANAGER_IMPORT_TABLE"
```
-> **Hint:** The scopetype and adom for import will directly inherit the scopetype and adom configuration of the provider.
